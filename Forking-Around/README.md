# <p align="center">Just Forking Around</p>

### <p align="center">This repository is for forked or referenced repositories used within ThemeCore.</p>

<br>

## The Reasons For This Repository Section.

 We have seen too many projects on GitHub and other repositories where bits of code, and sometimes even entire modules, get used and somehow get overlooked when it comes to publishing changes and giving credit where credit is due. It's not like we think it is done purposefully with any ill intent, it usually just happens as people get caught up in the project, and the numerous deadlines. 

***This repository is our honest attempt to try not to have this happen with ThemeCore.***

There are so many talented people worldwide that contribute and create things for the open source community. No matter if we use an entire module, or just a few lines of code that help us solve a bug, it is only fair that these people and or companies receive some recognition for their time, effort, and contributions to the worldwide open source community.

There are three forking file folders contained in this section. The first folder, **[Mandatory Forking](./mandatory_forking/)**, is for the projects out there that not only inspired the ideas behind ThemeCore, but made it possible to make ThemeCore a reality. Second, is the **[Necessary Forking](./necessary_forking/)** folder which contains projects or modules used within the various ThemeCore repositories. Finally the third folder **[Casual Forking](./casual_forking/)**, is a place for mentions of people or projects that we may have borrowed a single line of code from, or maybe their project showed us a way to solve a bug or issue, they too deserve to be mentioned.

No matter the reason, the type of license, or how small the help received from someones previous work, this is the way for those of us at ThemeCore to acknowledge those who paved the way for our project.

## Contributing

#### So, you want to come fork around with us? We can always use help with our forking adventures. 

[Contributing](./contributing.md) to our forking repository does not take a lot or coding skill. instead it requires some fairly good writing and editing in the english language for now, with the goal that other languages will be added later. This is a great starting point for someone just starting out on GitHub, and does not require much coding skill. For specifics on how the process works, see the [How To Fork Around](./how_to_fork_around.md) file.

### Licensing

The ThemCore forking section of this repository is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE.md). However, other projects each have their own licenses.

The individual licenses for each of the various projects will be contained in the projects subfolder. The type of license will also be mentioned on the README.md file in each of the forking folders. 

For projects that are not maintained, are too old, or that we may have borrowed an idea or piece of code from, the license will be listed along with the mention in the README.md file in the respective folder, wether or not the project is actually forked.
